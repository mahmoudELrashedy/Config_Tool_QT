   **Configuration Tool**

Description: 
The Configuration Tool is a QT-based application designed to configure UART and SPI communication parameters. It allows users to set various parameters such as BAUD rate, parity, stop bits, data bits for UART, and clock phase, clock polarity, master mode, prescaler, and SPI state for SPI communication.

Features:
- Configure UART communication parameters including BAUD rate, parity, stop bits, and data bits.
- Configure SPI communication parameters including clock phase, clock polarity, master mode, prescaler, and SPI state.
